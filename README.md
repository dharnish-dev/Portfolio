# Portfolio

My portfolio project is a compilation of my current projects, past experiences and future goals. It includes an overview of what I am currently working on as well as the skills that I have acquired so far in life. My resume document can be downloaded at the end for any potential employers who may wish to further their understanding about me or want more information than what they've just seen here!
